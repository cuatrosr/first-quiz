# üîí **Security Review for Solar Panel Application Infrastructure** üîë

<p style="text-align: justify">
    Software security is a crucial aspect when it comes to the infrastructure and data handling of an application. To ensure the security of our solar panel installation app, we will consider the OWASP Top 10 as a guide.
</p>

## üìÉ **¬øWhat is OWASP?** ‚úíÔ∏è

<p style="text-align: justify">
    OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), is a non-profit organization focused on enhancing the security of software. Each year they publish a document referred to as the "OWASP Top Ten." This document serves to bring attention to the most severe security risks associated with web applications. The "OWASP Top Ten" is highly regarded and serves as a foundational resource for software development and security professionals, aiding them in identifying and tackling prevalent security challenges in web applications.

## üîì **Security Recommendations Through OWASP Top Ten for 2021** üîí

<p style="text-align: justify">
    The OWASP Top 10 for 2021 report provides valuable guidance for identifying and addressing the most important web application security risks. Here's how these risks relate to our solar panel application infrastructure:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Loss of Access Control (A01:2021):</strong> Since we have differentiated employees and access roles (engineers, customer support, sales), robust and appropriate access control must be ensured so that employees only have access to the resources they need.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Cryptographic Flaws (A02:2021):</strong> As the application stores sensitive data, such as customer information and passwords. Then, it must be ensured that cryptography is properly implemented to protect this data and encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Injection (A03:2021):</strong> It is essential to protect the application, especially on the backend (Python and MySQL) against SQL injection and Cross-site scripting. For this, ensure user inputs are properly sanitized and use parameterized queries and prepared statements in your MySQL queries.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Insecure Design (A04:2021):</strong> Systems must be designed from the beginning with the best practices in design and security patterns. This is critical to prevent attacks that cannot be corrected with a perfect implementation. The deployment diagram must be reviewed to comply with industry standards.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021):</strong> Ensure that the configuration of your services on AWS and Kubernetes is secure and adheres to best practices. Ensure that you follow the principle of least privilege for your employees.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021):</strong> The presence of vulnerable and outdated components is a common concern. Regularly update dependencies that are reported as insecure and track known vulnerabilities.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021):</strong> Ensure that identification and authentication are strong to protect customer data and systems. Enforce proper access controls and authorization mechanisms to limit what users and employees can access and modify.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Software Failures and Data Integrity (A08:2021):</strong> Software must be able to recover from failures following the quality attribute of recoverability. Data integrity is crucial to maintain customer confidence.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Failures in recording and monitoring (A09:2021):</strong> In relation to fault responsiveness. Ensure adequate logging and monitoring. This includes monitoring for unusual activities, potential security breaches, and audit trails of who accessed what data.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Server Side Request Forgery (A10:2021):</strong> Protect endpoints with best practices (JWT, API Key) to ensure that requests to the server are truthful.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    To ensure the security of your infrastructure, you should address these risks through secure development practices, regular security testing and training of your staff. Security is an integral part of your business and should be treated as such to ensure the protection of customer data and system integrity, consider performing security testing specific to your application and staying on top of the latest security threats.
